 Thank you for your response. I also though about allowing POST and DELETE in the action, but if I do so, I'd have to check if the user has or hasn't liked the post in the frontend; wouldn't that be bypassable? I mean, users would be able to modify the JS and, for example, like a post infinite times.
 Maybe when fetching the post I could add to the response body if the user has or hasn't liked that particular post through the serializer. Then I would accept POST and DELETE requests in the actions and, for example, if the request is POST, but the user has already liked the post I'd return a 401 so it's not possible to bypass the frontend check and give infinite likes.
